as the file was huge and comparing all the lines would have made my job very difficult so just know what has changed helped find the error easily 

*****WINDOWS****
cmd
FC file_old.txt file_new.txt

****LINUX*****
diff -u file_old.txt file_new.txt

****GIT*****
git log
git log --stat
exit - q
git diff commit_id_1 commit_id_2
git clone https://github.com/udacity/asteroids.git
git config --global color.ui auto
git checkout -- gets the commit to a particular commit
having the old code can help me figure out my errors and also at any point of time I will have a working version


Pros of manual commit s
* I know when to add a logical stop 
* Commits are small and meaniful for history

Cons of manual commits
*I can forget to commit for days
*Too many commits

//****THUMB RULE********//
A good rule of thumb is to make one commit per logical change. 

/****************ERROR MSG*************/
Should not be doing an octopus
Octopus is a strategy Git uses to combine many different versions of code together. This message can appear if you try to use this strategy in an inappropriate situation.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state
HEAD is what Git calls the commit you are currently on. 
You can “detach” the HEAD by switching to a previous commit, which we’ll see in the next video. Despite what it sounds like, it’s actually not a bad thing to detach the HEAD. 
Git just warns you so that you’ll realize you’re doing it.


/**********************/
I can always go back to my previous commit
